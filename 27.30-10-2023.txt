today, i have finished the ecommerce application using java. functions in the application, register & login, 
show products by category , and show all the products to the user, addtocart: to add products to buy, orders: to view the bought products.
 
when user is new he has to register and those credentials has to be stored, for that we used file handling concepts to store the user credntials.
and when they login , it has to be same credentials.
 
file handling concepts is also used in category, products , addtocart, orders.
    -> Category: separate file is kept to store and add the category of the product.
    -> product: this file contains all the products to be shown to the user.
    -> addtocart: when user logged and add products to cart , it will be shown. but when they loggedout and login again , the cart products won't be there.
        so i have created a file with a userid and store the cart products in both csv and text file.
    -> orders: when the user checkout the product, bill invoice will be created and stored as a text file,
        and this file will be shown to user in orderspage.
 
the Admin can do CRUD operation to the category and products file, view registered users, and also orders of every user.
 
after finishing the application, we have been given a small task on date to practice.
