list: 4 ways to create
->list : list<string> a = list.of(scjhksjdhvj) => we cant add to these created list.
->arraylist : access elements faster.
->linkedlist :
->vector list: same as arraylist but it is thread safe.
 
set: dont allow duplicate
hashset: not stored in sorted order, but in random order
linkedset: store in the same order as user insert item
treeset: stored in random order
 
map:
hashmap:
treemap: stores key value pairs and allows navigating through keys or values
 
thread: 2-ways to create
-> extending thread
-> implements runnable
